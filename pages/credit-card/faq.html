		<h2>Q. Why is the jQuery Foundation offering a jQuery branded card when others exist? </h2>
		<p>A. Individuals have been requesting that The jQuery Foundation offer additional ways to support the community. The credit card is a great way of publicly showing your support for jQuery where 100% of proceeds go directly to sponsoring the mission of the jQuery Foundation - development of jQuery projects, documentation, events, and work in standards bodies.</p>

		<h2>Q. How does opening a credit card with UMB benefit jQuery Foundation?</h2>
		<p>A. The jQuery Foundation receives $50 for each approved application that is activated and used within 90 days of approval. Additionally, a percentage of every retail purchase made using the card will be donated to jQuery Foundation. 100% of those proceeds will go toward providing community technical events and travel funding.</p>

		<h2>Q. Who is UMB?</h2>
		<p>UMB a multi-bank, multi-billion dollar holding company headquartered in Kansas City, Missouri, was recently ranked by Smart Money as "the highest-scoring traditional bank among our favorites." As a leading card issuer with nearly 40 years of credit card experience, UMB offers a wide range of consumer and commercial Visa and private label products. For more information, visit <a href="https://www.umb.com">www.umb.com</a>.</p>

		<h2>Q. When I apply for the card, who collects the information and issues me the card?</h2>
		<p>A. Itâ€™s important to point out that there is no financial relationship between card applicants and The jQuery Foundation. The financial relationship card holders have is with Kansas City-based UMB. Approved applicants will receive a credit card from UMB, not The jQuery Foundation. The jQuery Foundation does not receive financial or personal information about any card applicants; this information is collected by UMB and is not passed to the jQuery Foundation.</p>

		<h2>Q. Is the jQuery Foundation sharing its contact lists with CardPartner or UMB?</h2>
		<p>A. No. The jQuery Foundation does not share its lists to CardPartner, UMB, or any other party. The jQuery Foundation makes available the credit card program, as a means to support the community.</p>

		<h2>Q. Is there an annual fee?</h2>
		<p>A. No, there is no annual fee.</p>

		<h2>Q. What is the interest rate on the card?</h2>
		<p>A. 0% for the first six month introductory period on purchases and balance transfers. After the six month introductory period, the interest rate will be the federal prime rate +8.74%.</p>

		<h2>Q. Can I apply over the phone?</h2>
		<p>A. Unfortunately, not at this time.</p>

		<h2>Q. How can I get an application by mail?</h2>
		<p>We encourage you to apply securely online to help us reduce marketing and processing costs. If you need a paper application, contact <a href="mailto:richard@jquery.com">richard@jquery.com</a>.</p>

		<h2>Q. When I apply for the card, will my transaction be secure?</h2>
		<p>A. Yes. Your application will be transmitted to UMB through an encrypted security page.</p>

		<h2>Q. Do I have to activate and use the card within a certain time period for the jQuery Foundation to receive the $50?</h2>
		<p>A. Yes. But you only need to use the card once within the first 90 days for us to receive the $50 bounty. Of course, we encourage you to make it your primary card because jQuery Foundation receives a percentage of every retail purchase at no additional cost to you.
		</p>

		<h2>Q. What are Bonus Rewards Points?</h2>

		(Note: You'll have to use IE or Firefox to complete the application through the above link. We realize that this seems particularly crazy when you consider that this is the <strong>jQuery</strong> credit card we're talking about. Unfortunately, CardPartner is still working on an update that will support all modern browsers. In the meantime, please bear with us and use IE or Firefox to apply. Or let us know of a UA spoof that does the trick!)
